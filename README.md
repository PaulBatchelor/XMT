# XMT
XMT (XM Tools), is a small C library geared towards
procedurally generating
[XM files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XM_(file_format)).

XMT started out as an aimless project in 2014 that really
didn't go anywhere. Years later, I found myself interested
in the concept again, so I jumped in and tried cleaning some
stuff up.

Lots of refactoring and other structural changes are
happening right now. Come back later when the dust has
settled...
